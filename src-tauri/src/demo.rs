//! The seeded sample meeting (Setup V3, Phase B).

//! A brand-new library is never empty: one finished meeting — transcript *and*

//! ordinary meeting row in every respect (deletable, searchable, exportable,
//! no audio), so nothing anywhere else special-cases it.
//!
//! Seeded once, on fresh installs only: both the `demo_meeting_seeded` flag
//! must be unset AND the meetings table must be empty. The flag is set either
//! way, so an existing library is asked about exactly once and never seeded.

Hamza: Welcome to Adversaria — I'm Hamza, the Chief Note Taker. This meeting you're reading was written by Adversaria itself, entirely on this computer, and that's the whole idea: nothing you say in a meeting ever leaves your machine.
Hamza: Here's how you use it. When a meeting starts, hit the record button at the top. Adversaria captures both sides of the call — your microphone and the other participants.
Hamza: When you stop, the transcript and structured notes like these write themselves in the background. You don't type a thing.
Hamza: Every action item agreed in a call lands on the To-dos board automatically. If you connect an AI agent, it can pick one up, do the work, and report back — and only you can mark it done.
Hamza: The Weekly tab writes you a briefing of each week's meetings. Ask answers questions across everything you've ever recorded. Graph connects the people and topics.
Hamza: Two things to set up before your first meeting: your transcription model, and how notes get written. Both live in Settings, under AI Model — your to-dos will walk you through it.
Hamza: That's everything. Delete this meeting whenever you like — it's yours, like everything else here. And if Adversaria saves you time, come tell me: connect with me on LinkedIn.";

/// which accepts any heading — and by `storage::extract_action_items`, which

const DEMO_SUMMARY: &str = "\
**Welcome**

- Adversaria is a private meeting notetaker: recording, transcription, and notes all happen on this computer, and nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- These notes were written by Adversaria itself — open the Transcript tab to see what they were written from. Delete this meeting whenever you like.

**How to use Adversaria**

- When a meeting starts, hit the record button at the top — both sides of the call are captured, your microphone and the other participants.
- Stop the recording and the transcript and notes write themselves in the background; you don't type a thing.
- Action items agreed in a call land on the To-dos board automatically. A connected AI agent can work on them and report back — only you can mark them done.
- Weekly writes a briefing of each week's meetings; Ask answers questions across everything you've recorded; Graph connects the people and topics.

**Action Items**

- Me: Download your transcription model in Settings → AI Model.
- Me: Choose how your notes get written — a local model, or your own AI provider.
- Me: Record your first meeting with Adversaria.
- Me: Open the notes it writes, then tick these off on the To-dos board.

**From the Chief Note Taker**

- Thanks for trying Adversaria. If it saves you time — or if it doesn't — I want to hear about it.
- — Mohammad Hamza Laghari, Chief Note Taker. Connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhlaghari/";
