# Adversaria

> Formerly "Meeting Note Taker". The app/bundle is now **Adversaria** (a Laghari
> Labs product). The on-disk data dir is still `meeting-note-taker`, so existing
> meetings carry over unchanged.

A privacy-first, bot-free AI meeting notetaker for **Windows and macOS** (Apple
Silicon), inspired by Granola. It records your system audio **and your microphone**
during a meeting (no bot joins the call), transcribes it locally with your pick
of on-device engines — **Whisper**
([faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) on Windows/CUDA,
MLX on Apple Silicon), **Qwen3-ASR** (52 languages, auto-detected), or **Cohere
Transcribe** (accuracy pick, 14 languages) — and generates structured notes with
a managed local LLM (Rapid-MLX on macOS, or Ollama on Windows). In the default local mode, meeting
audio, transcripts, and prompts stay on the machine. Optional cloud/BYOK modes
are explicit and disclosed before use; see [the network-boundary guide](docs/PRIVACY_NETWORK_BOUNDARIES.md).

## Features

- **Record → transcribe → summarize**, fully on-device; the audio is deleted right after.
- **A recording companion view** — while recording, the app collapses into a slim panel made for docking beside a call: record bar (timer · live audio level · Stop & summarize), an auto-scrolling live transcript, and your notes split 50/50 (or pick **Transcript-first** in Settings → Recording view to give the transcript the whole window, notes in a one-tap footer). Toggle recording from anywhere with **⌘⇧M** (macOS) / **Ctrl+Shift+M** (Windows); **⌘⇧N** jots a quick note.
- **Meeting Room** — at wide window sizes the live transcript docks beside your notes instead of stacking above them, and **+ add context** lets you attach reference documents or prior meeting summaries mid-recording. Attachments fold into the summary as reference material.
- **A floating recording pill** — switch away from the app mid-recording and a compact pill tucks in just below the notch (dot · timer · live waveform). Choose **Notch pill → Expressive** in Settings → Notch & alerts for a richer island — timer, the running live caption, both channels, and a one-tap Stop — or **Hidden** to turn it off.
- **Speaker-labeled** transcript (`Me:` / `Them:`, with on-device **Speaker 1/2/… diarization** of the remote side); notes in **10 languages** (English, العربية, 中文, हिन्दी, Español, Français, বাংলা, Português, Русский, اردو — or *Match spoken*), RTL rendered properly.
- **Fix this word** — select a misheard term in the transcript, type the correction, and every mention in the transcript *and* notes updates; the term joins your dictionary so future meetings hear it right. **Rename an attendee** on their chip and every reference follows.
- **Appearance themes** — Dark (default), Light, Cream, Navy, Laghari Labs, or System, from Settings → General.
- **Smart note templates** — the app detects what a recording is (watched video, brainstorm, 1:1, **job interview — either side of the table**) and picks the matching notes template automatically; your manual template choice always wins.
- **Meeting Insights** — on-device speaking stats per meeting (talk-time share, pace vs the 130–175 wpm target, filler-word rate, interruptions, longest monologue) computed with zero AI calls; transcripts carry **[MM:SS] timestamps** per turn.
- **To-dos** — action items from every meeting on a **triage board** (Overdue / This week / Later lanes with **drag-and-drop** — drops edit the due date) or a **focus queue** (one next-up card at a time), with meeting-scope chips, editable due dates, and **twice-daily due/overdue notification digests**.
- **Meeting projects** — file related meetings into colored project folders from the Meetings sidebar (menu or drag-and-drop), then open a project view with a source-grounded AI overview, attendee frequency, filed meetings, and open action items. Standing instructions guide both the overview and future workspace-task briefs, and a per-project Web research switch controls network access (off is fully on-device). Deleting a project leaves its meetings intact and unfiled.
- **Weekly Briefing** — your week written by the local LLM ("your week in sixty seconds"), plus stats, decisions made, and open loops carried forward.
- **Ask across meetings** — cross-meeting Q&A (SQLite FTS5 retrieval) answered by the local LLM.
- **Knowledge Graph** — an interactive, physics-animated map of your meetings, people, tags, and action owners (built from local data, zero LLM). Click any node for a **side dossier**: meeting-notes previews, and **editable person profiles** (role, company, notes, aliases) that sync to your Obsidian vault alongside meeting notes.
- **Import & export** — import a voice memo/audio file into notes; export a meeting as a dark **slide** (HTML → one-page PDF), **Markdown**, or a portable **`.adversaria.json` bundle**; back up / restore everything from Settings → Data.
- **A sidebar that stays short** — compact one-line rows (category dot · title · time) grouped into date bins (Pinned / Today / Yesterday / This week / month), with details in a hover peek (or switch back to the classic full cards in Settings); **archive any meeting** from its ⋯ menu (older ones auto-archive after a configurable window) into a collapsed, always-searchable **Archive**; the open meeting is highlighted; type **`@` in search to filter by person** (attendee chips that combine with text, day, and tag filters).
- Colorful per-meeting **tags** + a **date heatmap** filter, **pin / delete / privacy-lock** (per-meeting PIN), **editable summaries**, **chat with a meeting**, **custom vocabulary**, and **auto-detect meetings**.

## Install (macOS, Apple Silicon)

The packaged app bundles the Python ML service — **no terminal needed at runtime**.

1. Build the installer (one command; needs the dev toolchain in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-dmg.sh
   ```
   → produces `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Adversaria-<version>-<channel>-macos-arm64.dmg` (plus the stable-named `Adversaria-macos-arm64.dmg`).
2. Open the `.dmg`, drag **Adversaria** to **Applications**, and launch it.
3. Complete the in-app setup. Adversaria checks hardware, recommends a local
   model sized to your Mac (recommended, not forced — you can switch it later in
   **Settings → AI Engine**), downloads and verifies it, starts its bundled
   Rapid-MLX runtime, and runs a sample summary. No Homebrew, Python, or
   separately launched server is needed.

The model download is several gigabytes and the first local warm-up can take a
few minutes. A locally built ad-hoc DMG is for development only. Public builds
must pass the signed/notarized release gates in [CODEX_PLAN.md](docs/CODEX_PLAN.md).

## How it works

```
React UI  ──invoke──▶  Tauri (Rust)  ──HTTP──▶  Python ML service (FastAPI :9876)
                        │                        ├─ Whisper / Qwen3-ASR / Cohere (transcription)
                        │                        └─ managed Rapid-MLX / Ollama
                        ├─ native capture → encrypted chunk spool
                        └─ SQLCipher meeting history + OS-keychain keys
```

1. Press **⌘⇧M** (macOS) / **Ctrl+Shift+M** (Windows) — or use the tray menu — to start recording; the Rust
   backend captures system audio (WASAPI loopback on Windows, a Core Audio
   process tap on macOS — no screen-recording session involved) plus your mic.
2. Press it again to stop. The encrypted spool is decrypted for the Python
   service, which transcribes it and summarizes the transcript with your chosen
   prompt template.
3. The meeting (title, transcript, summary) is saved to SQLite and shown in the
   UI. **The audio file is deleted immediately after the meeting is saved.**

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Install |
|------|-----|---------|
| Rust (stable) | Tauri backend | https://rustup.rs |
| Node.js 18+ | React frontend | https://nodejs.org |
| Python 3.11+ & [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | ML service | `pip install uv` or the uv installer |
| Ollama | Local LLM summarization | https://ollama.com/download |
| NVIDIA GPU + CUDA/cuDNN | *Optional* — faster transcription | falls back to CPU automatically |

Pull a summarization model once (configured default on Windows is
`qwen3.6:35b-a3b`; any Ollama model works — set it in Settings):

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3.6:35b-a3b
```

Also pull the embedding model that powers semantic cross-meeting Ask search
(v0.3.30+; optional — without it, Ask silently falls back to keyword-only
search):

```powershell
ollama pull bge-m3
```

## Running (development)

You need two processes: the Python ML service and the Tauri app. The commands
below are for Windows.

> **macOS (Apple Silicon):** setup differs — MLX transcription + Rapid-MLX for the
> LLM, `uv sync --extra mlx`, and `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1` (or the model download
> hangs). Follow the macOS runbook in [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md).

**Terminal 1 — Python ML service:**

```powershell
cd python-service
uv sync
uv run uvicorn src.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9876 --log-level info
```

> The first start downloads the whisper `large-v3` model (~3 GB). On a machine
> without an NVIDIA GPU the service automatically falls back to CPU — consider
> `WHISPER_MODEL=medium` (see below), as `large-v3` is slow on CPU.

**Terminal 2 — the desktop app:**

```powershell
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Verify everything is connected: open **Settings** in the app — the service
status indicator should be green — or check manually:

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9876/health
# {"status":"ok","whisper_model":"large-v3","ollama_available":true}
```

### Try it out

1. Start a recording with **⌘⇧M** (macOS) / **Ctrl+Shift+M** (Windows), the tray menu, or the in-app button.
2. Play any audio with speech (a meeting, a YouTube video, a voice note).
3. Stop the recording. After transcription + summarization finishes, the meeting
   appears in the list with a transcript and structured summary.

## Configuration

### App config

Stored at `%APPDATA%\meeting-note-taker\config.json`, editable in the Settings UI:

| Key | Default | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `python_service_url` | `http://127.0.0.1:9876` | ML service base URL |
| `default_prompt_template` | `general` | Any template in `python-service/prompts/`: `general`, `one-on-one`, `client-meeting`, `brainstorm`, `youtube`, `interview` |
| `archive_after_days` | `30` | Days before an unpinned meeting folds into the sidebar Archive; `0` = never (search always spans the archive) |
| `sidebar_view` | `compact` | Sidebar meeting-list style: `compact` (one-line rows, details on hover) or `full` (classic cards with snippet and tags) |
| `recording_view` | `balanced` | Layout while recording: `balanced` (live transcript + notes, 50/50) or `transcript` (transcript-first, notes in a footer); applies at the next recording start |
| `ollama_model` | `qwen3.6:35b-a3b` (Win) / hardware-selected pinned profile (macOS) | LLM model name sent to the service |
| `summary_language` | `en` | One of ten note languages (`en`, `ar`, `zh`, `hi`, `es`, `fr`, `bn`, `pt`, `ru`, `ur`) or `auto` (match the spoken language) |
| `user_name` | (blank) | Your display name; replaces the `Me:` speaker label in new transcripts |
| `custom_vocabulary` | (blank) | Names/companies/jargon (comma- or newline-separated) to bias transcription spelling |
| `auto_detect_meetings` | `false` | Prompt to record when a call app uses your mic (mic-based, **not** calendar) |
| `claude_api_key` | `null` | Legacy/reserved. Cloud & self-hosted BYOK live in Settings (transcription engine + notes engine base URL/key) |

### Personalizing transcription & notes

- **Your Name** — set it in Settings to have your spoken lines labeled with your
  name instead of `Me:` in the transcript, so the notes attribute your action
  items to you by name.
- **Custom Vocabulary** — add names, companies, and jargon (comma- or
  newline-separated) so transcription spells them correctly. It's fed to Whisper
  as an `initial_prompt` on both the Windows/CUDA and Apple-Silicon backends.

### Enabling auto-detect

Auto-detect is **off by default**. To turn it on: **Settings → tick "Auto-detect
meetings" → click _Save Settings_** (ticking alone doesn't apply it — you must
Save). No restart needed. When a recognized call app (Zoom, Teams, Webex, Slack,
or a browser meeting like Google Meet) uses your mic for ~4–6 s, a floating
"Meeting detected — Record / Dismiss" card appears. It's **mic-based, not
calendar-based**, and never records on its own — you click _Record_. macOS 14.4+
only; WhatsApp/FaceTime aren't recognized yet.

### ML service environment variables

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `large-v3` | e.g. `medium`, `small` — smaller is faster on CPU |
| `WHISPER_DEVICE` | `auto` | `auto` tries CUDA, falls back to CPU; or force `cuda`/`cpu` |
| `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` | `float16` | `int8` is used automatically on CPU |
| `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET` | (unset) | Set to `1` on macOS if the MLX model download hangs at 0 bytes (broken `hf_xet`) |

Example (CPU-friendly):

```powershell
$env:WHISPER_MODEL = "medium"
uv run uvicorn src.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9876 --log-level info
```

### Prompt templates

Templates live in `python-service/prompts/*.md`. Each is a system prompt with a
`{{transcript}}` placeholder. Add your own by dropping a new `.md` file in that
directory — it appears in the API and template list automatically.

## Testing

## Privacy

- In default local mode, meeting audio, transcript text, and prompts stay on the
  device. Explicit cloud transcription or cloud summary sends only the data
  disclosed in Settings and onboarding.
- Captures are encrypted while recording/pending and deleted after successful
  processing; failed processing remains encrypted and visibly retryable.
- Transcripts and summaries are stored locally in SQLite
  (`%APPDATA%\meeting-note-taker\meetings.db`).
- No analytics or automatic crash-report upload. Registration, model downloads,
  updates, calendar integrations, and optional cloud providers are documented in
  [Privacy and Network Boundaries](docs/PRIVACY_NETWORK_BOUNDARIES.md).

## Known limitations

- The live caption while recording is a best-effort rolling preview; the
  authoritative transcript is produced when you stop.
- Speaker labels are channel-based (`Me:` = your mic, `Them:` = system audio),
  and the remote side is diarized into **Speaker 1/2/…** — but diarized
  speakers aren't matched to real names automatically yet (rename them on
  their attendee chip).
- The packaged app uses the system **ffmpeg** (Homebrew) via `PATH`; bundling a
  static ffmpeg for portability to other Macs is pending.
- **Calendar integration** is macOS-only today (EventKit, read-only, zero
  sign-in). Google/Microsoft OAuth calendars for Windows are specced
  (`docs/SPEC_CALENDAR.md`) but not built.
