# ── context-window sizing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Ollama defaults to a 2048-token context regardless of the model's real
# capacity, which silently truncates long meeting transcripts, so num_ctx is
# always sent. It used to be a fixed 16,384 — which is *too small* for a long
# meeting summarized by a verbose reasoning model (live 2026-08-10:
# muse-glimmer:30b-mlx spent its window thinking and the note came back cut off)
# and needlessly large for a five-minute standup. The window is now computed per
# request from the actual prompt, so no user ever has to know this knob exists.

#: Never size below this. It is what shipped, it covers ~90 minutes of speech,
#: and it is safe on modest hardware — so adaptive sizing can only ever add.
NUM_CTX_FLOOR = 16384

#: Conservative chars-per-token divisor for estimating prompt tokens. Measured
#: 2026-08-10 on the real tokenizer (qwen3.5:2b, prompt_eval_count over 2k-char
#: samples): English 5.15, Arabic 3.72, code-switched Arabic/English 4.13
#: chars/token. 3 sits under the densest of those with margin — under-estimating
#: the prompt is what truncates a note; over-estimating only costs a little RAM.
CHARS_PER_TOKEN = 3

#: Tokens reserved on top of the prompt for the model's answer. Generous on
#: purpose: a reasoning model spends thinking tokens *before* the note, and the
#: live-incident note alone was ~5k tokens.
OUTPUT_BUDGET_TOKENS = 8192

#: Windows are rounded up to a multiple of this — a tidy number to log and
#: reason about, and it stops one extra transcript line changing the window.
NUM_CTX_STEP = 2048

        Uses Ollama structured output (the LLM is constrained to the
        ``MeetingNotes`` JSON schema), then renders Markdown for display and
        extracts the attendee list and a title.

        Args:
            transcript: The raw meeting transcript text.
            template_name: Name of the prompt template to use (e.g. 'general').
            model: Ollama model override; defaults to the summarizer's model.
            attached_context: User-attached reference material. It may resolve
                names and details but is never evidence of what this meeting said.
            base_url: When non-empty, route through the OpenAI-compatible path
                with this URL + api_key regardless of the default backend.
            api_key: API key for the cloud provider (used with base_url).
            known_attendees: Canonical participant names (e.g. from a calendar
                roster or user-edited attendee list). When non-empty, a
                directive is injected encouraging the LLM to use these exact
                spellings, and extracted names are grounded to the closest
                roster entry before deduplication.
            meeting_date: The recording's date as ISO ``YYYY-MM-DD``. When
                well-formed, a single date line is added to the system prompt so
                spoken relative deadlines resolve to absolute dates. Absent or
                malformed leaves the prompt untouched.

        Returns:
            SummarizeResponse with markdown ``summary``, ``title``, and
            ``attendees`` (display strings).
